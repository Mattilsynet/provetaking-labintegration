## üîπ API Overview
The **Lab Integration API** allows laboratories to programmatically manage the entire lifecycle of a sample analysis. Key functionalities include:
* **Polling** for new or updated requisitions.
* **Acknowledging** receipt of digital requisitions.
* **Updating the status** of a sample as it moves through the lab (e.g., sample received, analysis started).
* **Submitting analysis results**, including optional file attachments.
* **Finalizing the process** by marking the analysis as complete.

**Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation:**
* **Development/Sandbox:** [https://sample.sample-dev.mattilsynet.io/swagger-ui/index.html](https://sample.sample-dev.mattilsynet.io/swagger-ui/index.html?urls.primaryName=Endpoints+for+lab+integration)
* **Production:** `https://sample.sample.mattilsynet.io/swagger-ui/index.html`

## üîë Authentication with Maskinporten
Authentication between the laboratory and the NFSA is handled by **Maskinporten**, which is based on the OAuth 2.0 standard.

### Setup Requirements
Before you can authenticate, you must complete a one-time setup process:
1.  **Obtain a Norwegian Business ID:** Your organization must have a Norwegian `organisasjonsnummer`. Foreign companies can obtain one by registering as a [Norwegian-registered foreign company (NUF)](https://info.altinn.no/en/start-and-run-business/planning-starting/Choosing-Legal-Structure/norwegian-branch-of-a-foreign-company-nuf/).
2.  **Create a Maskinporten Account:** Register your organization in Maskinporten.
3.  **Generate a Key Pair:** Create a public/private key pair (e.g., RSA). The public key must be associated with your account in Maskinporten.
4.  **Request API Access:** Provide your `organisasjonsnummer` to the NFSA. We will then grant your organization the necessary access rights (scopes) for our APIs.

### Acquiring an Access Token
To make API calls, you must first request an access token from Maskinporten. This is done by creating and signing a **JWT** with your private key and exchanging it for an access token.

* **Grant Type:** `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`
* **Authentication Method:** `private_key_jwt`
* **Scope:** `mattilsynet:provetaking`

For a detailed guide on creating the JWT and requesting the token, see the official documentation from Digdir: [Maskinporten API Consumer Guide](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_guide_apikonsument) (Norwegian).

### Using the Access Token
The obtained access token must be included in the `Authorization` header of every API request as a Bearer token. The token has an expiration time defined by the `exp` claim.

**Example Header:**
`Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>`

## üåç Environments & Versioning

### Environments
| Environment | Base URL | Authentication | Data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sandbox / Dev** | `https://sample.sample-dev.mattilsynet.io` | Maskinporten (Ver2) | Synthetic test data |
| **Production** | `https://sample.sample.mattilsynet.io` | Maskinporten | Real data |

### Versioning
The API uses media type versioning via the **`Accept` header**. Always specify the version you are targeting to ensure compatibility.

**Example Header:**
`Accept: application/vnd.mattilsynet.proveta.labv2+json`

## üîÑ Operational Workflow
The following diagram illustrates the standard sequence of operations for processing a requisition.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant LAB as Laboratory
    participant MT as NFSA API
    participant GCS as Google Cloud Storage

    Note over LAB, MT: 1. Poll for new or updated requisitions.
    LAB->>MT: GET /requisitions?processed=false
    MT-->>LAB: 200 OK (List of requisitions)

    Note over LAB, MT: 2. Acknowledge receipt of the digital requisition.
    LAB->>MT: POST /requisitions/{id}/processed
    MT-->>LAB: 200 OK

    Note over LAB, MT: 3. Notify when the physical sample bag arrives.
    LAB->>MT: POST /requisitions/{id}/sample-received
    MT-->>LAB: 200 OK

    Note over LAB, MT: 4. Signal analysis has started.<br/>Requisition is now locked from further updates by NFSA.
    LAB->>MT: POST /requisitions/{id}/analysis-started
    MT-->>LAB: 200 OK

    Note over LAB, MT: 5. Submit analysis results.<br/>Can be called multiple times.
    LAB->>MT: POST /requisitions/{id}/results (payload)
    MT-->>LAB: 201 Created (Result ID: 4321)

    alt 6. Optional: Add file attachments to a result
        Note over LAB, MT: Request a secure upload URL.
        LAB->>MT: POST /requisitions/{id}/results/4321/attachments
        MT-->>LAB: 200 OK (Google Cloud Storage signed URL)

        Note over LAB, GCS: Upload the file directly to the provided URL.
        LAB->>GCS: POST/PUT {file data} to signed URL
        GCS-->>LAB: 200 OK
    end

    Note over LAB, MT: 7. Signal completion of all analysis.<br/>No more results or attachments can be submitted.
    LAB->>MT: POST /requisitions/{id}/analysis-completed
    MT-->>LAB: 200 OK
```

## üö¶ Requisition State Model
This diagram shows the possible states of a requisition and the API calls that trigger transitions between them.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unprocessed
    Unprocessed --> Processed: POST /processed
    Processed --> Unprocessed: (NFSA updates requisition)
    Processed --> SampleReceived: POST /sample-received
    SampleReceived --> InAnalysis: POST /analysis-started
    InAnalysis --> InAnalysis: POST /results
    InAnalysis --> Completed: POST /analysis-completed
    Completed --> [*]

    note right of Unprocessed
      Visible via GET /requisitions?processed=false
    end note
    note right of Unprocessed
      Re-appears in GET /requisitions?processed=false
    end note
    note right of InAnalysis
      After analysis has started, NFSA can no longer update the requisition.
    end note
    note right of Completed
      No further results or attachments are accepted.
    end note
```

## üìã API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/requisitions` | `GET` | Fetch a list of requisitions. Use `?processed=false` to get only new or updated ones. |
| `/requisitions/{id}` | `GET` | Fetch details for a single requisition by its ID. |
| `/requisitions/{id}/processed` | `POST` | Acknowledge that a requisition has been retrieved and stored in the lab system. |
| `/requisitions/{id}/sample-received`| `POST` | Mark that the physical sample has arrived at the laboratory. |
| `/requisitions/{id}/analysis-started`| `POST` | Signal that analysis has begun. This locks the requisition from further NFSA updates. |
| `/requisitions/{id}/results` | `POST` | Submit a batch of analysis results. Can be called multiple times. |
| `/requisitions/{id}/results/{resultId}/attachments` | `POST` | Request a secure, one-time URL to upload a file attachment for a specific result. |
| `/requisitions/{id}/analysis-completed`| `POST` | Finalize the process. No more results or attachments will be accepted. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
| Status Code | Meaning | Common Cause | Recommended Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **200 OK** | Success | Standard successful response for idempotent calls. | Continue workflow. |
| **201 Created**| Resource Created | Successful submission of new results. | Store the returned resource ID. |
| **400 Bad Request**| Invalid Payload | The request body fails schema validation. | Correct the payload and retry. |
| **401 Unauthorized**| Authentication Failed| The access token is missing, expired, or invalid. | Request a new token and retry. |
| **403 Forbidden** | Insufficient Permissions| The token is valid but lacks the required scope. | Check your Maskinporten configuration. |
| **404 Not Found** | Resource Not Found | The specified requisition ID does not exist. | Verify the ID is correct. |
| **409 Conflict** | Illegal State | The requested action is not allowed in the requisition's current state. | Check the requisition's state before retrying. |
| **5xx** | Server Error | A temporary issue occurred on the NFSA's server. | Retry with an exponential backoff strategy. |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limits & Polling
* **Recommended Polling Frequency:** Poll `GET /requisitions?processed=false` once every **60 seconds**.
* **Minimum Interval:** Do not poll more frequently than once every **30 seconds** to avoid being rate-limited (HTTP 429).
* **Best Practice:** After fetching requisitions, **immediately** call `POST /requisitions/{id}/processed` for each one. This prevents you from receiving them again in subsequent polls unless they are updated by the NFSA.

---

## üíª Code Examples
*Replace `$TOKEN` with your valid Maskinporten access token.*
